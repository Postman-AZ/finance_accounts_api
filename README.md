We are transitioning to an API-First development and will plan to follow the best practices of Open Banking.

What Open Banking will Achieve
Open Banking allows account holders to seamlessly and securely link their bank account information with their platform or apps of choice.

Through the Open Banking API, a fintech can quickly create secure and personalized products and apps for its customers. While you can get access to our sandbox to start testing Open Banking in minutes, you would need to connect with real banks to be able to do real-life transactions.
